### Safe Trustworthy Autonomous Delivery System

This project started in the Fall of 2023 and marks the first iteration of the STAD project.

## Getting Started

Here you will find software, CAD design files and project assignments such as reports and posters.

Software installation is done by cloning the whole repository and installing from subfolders depending on what software is needed.

Guides and READMes are individual and independent of each other. They can be found in their respective subfolders.
